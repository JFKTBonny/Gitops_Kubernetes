Kustomize and Helm are both powerful tools that can be used for managing Kubernetes configurations,
but they approach configuration management differently and serve slightly different purposes within
the Kubernetes ecosystem...

********************************************************************* HELM  ****************************************************
Helm is  a package manager for Kubernetes... 
        It uses a packaging format called charts, which are collections of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources...
        Helm charts are templates that can be dynamically configured through the use of values that are passed at runtime...
        This feature allows complex applications and their dependencies to be deployed using a single command,
        making Helm particularly suitable for managing packaged applications and sharing them across a wide user base...
        Helm also supports versioning, which means you can manage and track releases of yourapplications,
        roll back to previous versions, and manage application deployment in a structured manner...

********************************************************************* KUSTOMIZE ***************************************************
Kustomize, on the other hand, introduces a template-free way of customizing Kubernetes applications...
It uses a base and overlay model where the base configuration can be overridden or extended by overlays without altering the original files...
Unlike Helm, Kustomize does not manage packages or dependencies; it focuses purely on configuration customization...

*****************************************************************************************************************************************
Helm is ideal for defining, installing,and upgrading complex Kubernetes applications as discrete packages,
while 
Kustomize excels at customizing and managing the configurations of these applications across various environments
without the need to maintain separate files for each environment...
