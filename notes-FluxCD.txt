FluxCD:

        A GitOps-based Continuous Delivery (CD) tool for Kubernetes.

        Automates syncing of cluster state with manifests stored in Git.

        Supports Helm, Kustomize, and multi-cluster setups.

        Continuously reconciles desired state (Git) with actual cluster state.

Advantages:

        Ensures consistent, declarative deployments across environments.

        Strong ecosystem support with CNCF project backing.

        Modular and extensible — integrates well with Helm charts and Git workflows.

        Automated drift detection and correction.

        Secure by design (pull-based model, no need to expose cluster API).

Usefulness in SDLC:

        Increases reliability and reproducibility of deployments.

        Enables faster delivery cycles with minimal manual intervention.

        Enhances collaboration via Git as the single source of truth.

        Simplifies operations in complex, multi-cluster environments.

Flux  embodies GitOps’ principles and is designed to automate the process of deploying to Kubernetes ... 
It ensures that the state of a cluster matches the configurations stored in a Git repository... 
Flux continuously monitors the repository and automatically applies any new changes to the target environment... 
This enables developers to manage and deploy their applications by simply updating their Git repositories ... 
Flux supports complex deployment strategies, including """canary and blue-green deployments""", and
integrates with Kubernetes to ensure that the actual state of live systems is always represented accurately in code...
