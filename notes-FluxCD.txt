FluxCD:

        A GitOps-based Continuous Delivery (CD) tool for Kubernetes.

        Automates syncing of cluster state with manifests stored in Git.

        Supports Helm, Kustomize, and multi-cluster setups.

        Continuously reconciles desired state (Git) with actual cluster state.

Advantages:

        Ensures consistent, declarative deployments across environments.

        Strong ecosystem support with CNCF project backing.

        Modular and extensible â€” integrates well with Helm charts and Git workflows.

        Automated drift detection and correction.

        Secure by design (pull-based model, no need to expose cluster API).

Usefulness in SDLC:

        Increases reliability and reproducibility of deployments.

        Enables faster delivery cycles with minimal manual intervention.

        Enhances collaboration via Git as the single source of truth.

        Simplifies operations in complex, multi-cluster environments.
