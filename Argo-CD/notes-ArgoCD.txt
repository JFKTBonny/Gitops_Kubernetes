Argo CD is a declarative tool for continuous delivery specifically designed for Kubernetes...
       It functions as a standalone solution or can be integrated into your existing CI/CD pipeline 
       to efficiently deploy necessary resources across your Kubernetes clusters... 
       t automates the process of deploying applications to specified target environments within Kubernetes clusters,
       ensuring that the live state is always in sync with the configurations stored in Git repositories...

       Argo CD follows GitOpsâ€™s principles,treating Git repositories as the source of truth for defining the desired application state, 
       thereby simplifying the deployment process and enhancing security and traceability...

       It provides a graphical user interface for visualizing the status of applications, their version control history,
       and the differences between the deployed and desired states...
       

Integrating GitOps and Kubernetes using Argo CD provides a streamlined approach for managing
cloud-native applications and jobs on Kubernetes...


Advantages: - Ensures consistent, version-controlled deployments. 
            - Reduces manual operations by auto-applying changes from Git. 
            - Easy rollback with Git history. - Improves security by using Git as the single source of truth. 
            - Provides real-time monitoring and quick feedback loops.

Usefulness in SDLC: - Guarantees reliable and reproducible deployments. 
                    - Improves collaboration between dev & ops through Git workflows. 
                    - Enables faster delivery while reducing errors in production.
