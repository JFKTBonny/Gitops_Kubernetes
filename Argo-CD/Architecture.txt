Argo CD is a prominent GitOps tool that’s designed for Kubernetes and enables automated, CD by
syncing application definitions, configurations, and environments directly from a Git repository...

*** Argo CD follows a client-server architecture:
    - Argo CD API server: The core service that provides the primary API for Argo CD, it handles user requests and performs application state analyses and reporting...
    - Repository server:  This service is responsible for fetching repository contents and returning manifest files.... 
                              It understands various configuration management tools, such as Helm, Kustomize,
                              Jsonnet, and others, enabling Argo CD to work with multiple types of manifests...
    -  Application controller: This is the key component that continuously monitors application definitions and configurations in the Git repository. ..
                                It compares the current state of the cluster with the desired state defined in Git and applies any necessary changes to align the two...                     
    - Argo CD UI and CLI: These services provide a visual interface and command-line tooling for users to manage applications, view their states, and perform various operations...
    - Dex server: An optional component for integrating with external identity providers for authentication...

Argo CD synchronization steps:
           - Monitoring:  Argo CD continuously monitors the specified Git repository for changes to the application definitions and configurations...
           - Comparison:  When changes are detected, Argo CD compares the new desired state defined in Git with the current state of the Kubernetes cluster...
           - Convergence: If discrepancies are found, Argo CD undertakes actions to reconcile the differences...
                          This could involve:*** creating, updating, or deleting*** Kubernetes resources to ensure the cluster’s state aligns with the configuration specified in the Git repository...
           - Self-healing: If the cluster state deviates from the Git-defined state due to manual changes or other factors, Argo CD automatically corrects these deviations to maintain consistency... 
           - Manual or automatic sync: Users can configure Argo CD to synchronize changes either automatically as they occur in the Git repository or require manual intervention for synchronization,
                                       providing flexibility based on the team’s workflow and policies...
