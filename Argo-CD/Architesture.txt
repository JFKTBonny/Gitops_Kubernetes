Flux is a powerful, open source tool that automates the deployment of applications within Kubernetes, embodying the principles of GitOps...
Flux consists of several key components that work together to monitor, pull, and apply configurations from a Git repository to a Kubernetes cluster:
         - Flux daemon (Fluxd): This is the core component that continuously monitors the configured Git repository... 
                                It checks for new commits to branches, tags, or specific paths and applies the changes to the Kubernetes cluster... 
         - Source controller: This component acquires source materials from repositories (such as Git) and detects if there are any changes...
         - Kustomize controller (for Flux v2): Applies Kustomize configurations, allowing raw Kubernetes manifests to be customized without the need to alter the original YAML files...
         - Helm controller (for Flux v2): Provides declarative management for Helm chart releases. This component allows Flux to manage Helm chart dependencies directly from Git...
         - Git repository: This is where the Kubernetes resource files (such as YAML manifests, Kustomize configurations, or Helm charts) are stored ... 
         - Synchronization: Flux continuously synchronizes the configuration from the Git repository with the Kubernetes cluster...
         - Automation and rollback: Flux supports automated deployments and rollbacks...
         - Security and secrets management: Flux provides mechanisms to handle secrets securely and supports integration with Kubernetes secrets management tools...
         - Observability and notifications: Flux can be configured to send notifications (for example, via Slack, email, or other messaging platforms) about the status of deployments and sync operations...
